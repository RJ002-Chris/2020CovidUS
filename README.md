# U.S. COVID-19 case/death Data Study
In this project, we will be look at the Covid-19 deaths and case count during 2020 using the data provided by [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). This data includes all the cases in 2020, using the population data from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates at the county level. In this project there will be 2 maps to showcase both counts, one is a [choropleth map](https://github.com/RJ002-Chris/2020CovidUS/blob/main/map1.html) of the covid-19 rates and the other is a [proportional symbols map](https://github.com/RJ002-Chris/2020CovidUS/blob/main/map2.html) of covid-19 cases as shown below:

#### Choropleth Map of the Covid-19 Rates Per 1000 in the U.S. (2020)

This is an interactive choropleth web map that allows users to see more information when hovering above certain areas. The different colors represent different Covid-19 rates as shown in the legend.

This is an interactive proportional symbols map that allows users to see more information when clicking on certain points. The different colors and size of the points represent different Covid-19 counts as shown in the legend.
